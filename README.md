# Game warping in an artificial bot-based economy
Game theoretic equilibria can be shifted by players through transparent, strictly enforceable, and frictionless agreements between themselves. 
Today, this is possible with smart contracts deployed on Turing-complete blockchains such as Ethereum. 

## Motivation
The dynamics of game warping were not studied in traditional game theory and economics due to practical difficulties of implementing transparent and
enforceable contracts between players. However, this is plausible with the advent of smart contracts, thus calling for an extensive study to mechanistically
understand artifical economies and the human-inconceivable stratgies that may emerge through artificially intelligent bot game players.
